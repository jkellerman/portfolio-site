              As a collaborative effort with a software engineer, my primary
              responsibilities for this project was developing reusable
              components and features within an existing codebase.

          <ProjectContent heading="The solution">
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              The project was built using DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service,
              which provided a reliable and secure data storage solution for the
              backend, and TypeScript, Next.js, and Styled-components for the
              frontend. As part of the development process, I utilised Storybook
              to create and test UI components in isolation. To implement the
              login authentication, I opted for Firebase due to its simple setup
              process and customisable login form options. Additionally, I set
              up unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing library
              to ensure reliability and functionality across the app

          <ProjectContent heading="Challenges">
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              As this was my first collaborative project, one of the obstacles I
              faced was getting acquainted with the existing codebase.
              Additionally, I had to familiarise myself with new technologies
              while adhering to coding standards, which was a challenging task.
              Despite the challenges, the project helped me develop skills in
              project management, communication, and problem-solving.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              Collaborating with a more experienced software engineer was
              invaluable to me. I gained knowledge of best practices for
              collaborating on app development, and I have since applied this
              knowledge to my own projects. However, the most significant
              takeaway for me was learning how to use Git in a pair programming
              scenario. While I was already familiar with Git, I learned best
              practices for making commits, managing conflicts, and
              participating in code reviews.
